# wingit_python
Capstone Project, done with Django/MongoDB/Microsoft Azure

This is old but for the sake of availability, I wanted to make this publicly available. Because some facets of this app was never
made a reality, as well as the fact that Django isn't a language I really want to work with anymore, I will be making it a new 
project to rework this with a Javascript full-stack (probably MongoDB/Express/React/Node), so look forward to that in the future!

For information on how to install/the project itself, please check the pdf in the repo.
